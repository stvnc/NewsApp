# This is NewsApp, an app built with news-api. This is a project using MVC Architecture and fully programmatic approach.

### Libraries used:

- <b>SDWebImage</b> for image related.

- <b>Firebase</b> for authentication and storage*, and <b>Realm</b> for Database*

### NB: * means optional, I'm still thinking if I should add those features into this apps, but maybe I'll add it for practice.


### Project Goals:

- Redo the whole UI (will redo the HomeViewController first)

- Add GCD
